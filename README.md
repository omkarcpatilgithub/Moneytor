Hotel management for Moneytor hotel


Hello ,

the code is not rest api based but you may consider dbconnect.py file (which connects to the DataBase) is an API.

before running the app.py file you will need to create a database and configure dbconnect.py file for connection
# explaination inside the dbconnect.py file

### before proceding further you may execute queries which are  stored in sqls.txt file.

as the code is only backend and works with command prompt, you can run CMD on the directory where app.py and run the file with "python app.py"

- in the directory you will notice app.py only calling the funtions, real processing is at dbconnect.py


for functionality mentioned
1. He wants to check for availability of rooms between certain dates.       # 3rd option 
2. He wants to book a room for a certain customer for certain time period if it is available.	# 4th option
